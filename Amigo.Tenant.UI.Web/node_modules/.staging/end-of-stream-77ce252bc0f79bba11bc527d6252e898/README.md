# end-of-stream

A node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.

	npm install end-of-stream

## Usage

Simply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.
Both legacy streams, streams2 and stream3 are supported.

``` js
var eos = require('end-of-stream');

eos(readableStream, function(err) {
  // this will be set to the stream instance
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended', this === readableStre
